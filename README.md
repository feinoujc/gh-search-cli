# NO LONGER MAINTAINED 

The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) has added functionality similar to this library (`gh search issues, ...`), so just use that instead.

gh-search-cli
=============
Provides a cli for searching github.com. Supports repositories, code, issues and commits. Can be configured for github enterprise instances as well. Built using [oclif](https://github.com/oclif/oclif)

# Setup

The cli requires a personal access token (`notifications` scope is needed for the notifications command). The cli will create a new token on the first run and store it for future use. If you prefer you can use your own token and config the cli yourself (see [ghs config](#ghs-config))
